Menu
Experience gastronomical delights — straight from Africa — as you take a big step toward bolstering your Anthony Bourdain-style street cred.
A feast filled with faraway flavors. As the hidden jewel inside a shopping center in North Druid Hills, Queen of Sheba Ethiopian Restaurant’s décor is evocative of a traditional Ethiopian dining experience. With walls lined with artwork and decoration straight from Africa, you can take your pick from enticing platters — including the popular all-vegetarian combo (which can feed up to five). Overall, this Queen has enough to satisfy the fussiest of diners. Dishes like yemesir w’et (spiced lentils in a red pepper sauce), yekik alicha (chickpeas with garlic and onion), tikel gomen (cabbage, potato and carrot simmered in a garlic and onion sauce) leap off the colorful menu. Yet, if you’re feeling a bit more carnivorous, they have many-an-entrée filled with succulent beef, poultry and lamb. Whether you’re planning a one-of-a-kind group dining experience or just want to explore uncharted foodie territory, Queen of Sheba is the perfect point of departure for any exotic food experience.
